# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

This repository tracks my daily progress as I learn Python.  
Each day I build a small project, practice coding, and document what I’ve learned.

## 📅 Daily Projects

- **Day 1** → [Hello World & Basics](Day01-HelloWorld/day1_basics.py)  
  *Practiced printing, variables, and basic syntax.*  

- **Day 2** → [Age Calculator](Day02-AgeCalculator/day2_age_calculator.py)  
  *Practiced input, type conversion, and simple math.*  

- **Day 3** → [Age Check with Conditions](Day03-AgeCheck/day3_age_check.py)  
  *Learned how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.*
