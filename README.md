# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

This repository tracks my daily progress as I learn Python.  
Each day I build a small project, practice coding, and document what I’ve learned.

## 📅 Daily Projects

- Day 1 → [Hello World & Basics](Day01-HelloWorld/day1_basics.py)  
  *Practiced printing, variables, and basic syntax. 

- Day 2 → [Age Calculator](Day02-AgeCalculator/day2_age_calculator.py)  
  Practiced input, type conversion, and simple math.

- Day 3 → [Age Check with Conditions](Day03-AgeCheck/day3_age_check.py)  
  Learned how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

  
  - Day 4 → [Password Generator](Day04-PasswordGenerator/day4_password_generator.py)  
  *Practiced `for` loops, random module, and working with strings.
